splice() changes the original array whereas slice() doesn't but both of them returns array object.

See the examples below:

var array=[1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(array.splice(2));
This will return [3,4,5]. The original array is affected resulting in array being [1,2].

var array=[1,2,3,4,5]
console.log(array.slice(2));
This will return [3,4,5]. The original array is NOT affected with resulting in array being [1,2,3,4,5].
